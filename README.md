# cs121project

## Hello Users,

UPDATE: New Dependency
- run `python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools`

To get this project running on your computer :
- navigate to `react-frontend`
- run `npm run build`
- navigate back to `ourproject`
- run `python microblog.py` or `FLASK_APP=microblog.py flask run`

You may need to install dependencies (webpack, babel, flask, etc.)

Developer Instructions:
- `app` contains all python files
- do **NOT** change `static` and `template` folders. There contents are auto-generated by `npm run build`
- changes to python can be seen by refreshing page, changes to HTML and Javascript require rerunning `npm run build`.
- `react-frontend` contains all react files
- `public` contains `index.html`
- `src` contains `App.js` - this is probably where you want to work

**Happy Coding!**
